# Description

Interactive website built to familiarize with React states and effects. It was based on the https://www.figma.com/file/ArN9tILyOsXrjgIFYXH5WT/Tenzies from the Learn React JS tutorial at Scrimba.com. I improved a design of dice faces, instead of just number it now displays dots on it. I also added functionality to track a time of the game and number of turns before the game is won.
